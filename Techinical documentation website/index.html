                </header>
                <p>C++ is a general purpose programming language 
                    and widely used now a days for competitive programming.
                    It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming 
                    features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux,
                    Unix, Mac etc. C++ is an efficient and powerful language and
                    finds wide usein various GUI platforms. 3D graphics and 
                    real-time simulations. Because of the inclusion of rich function 
                    libraries. Working in C++ becomes simpler and convienent than C.
                    Being object-oriented programming like Java. C++ provides the 
                    support of inheritance, polymorphism,encapsulation, etc. Unlike 
                    C, C++ allows exception hanbdling and function overloading.

                  <p>he "Hello World" program is the first step towards learning any
                      programming languagage and also one of the simplest progrms you
                      will learn. All you have to do is display the message "Helo World"
                      on the screen.

                  <p>C++ is an Object Oriented programming Language.
                      <br> The main pillars of Object Oriented 
                      Programming are:

                 <p>
                     Object-oriented programming- As the name suggests
                     uses objects in programming. Object-Oriented programming 
                     aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, 
                     hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim 
                     of OOP is to bind together the dta and the functions that 
                     operate on them so that no other part of the code can access
                     this data except that function.
                 </p>
                 <p><b>Object: </b>An object is an identifiable entity with some 
                characteristics and behavior. An object is an instance of a Class.
                 When a  class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is 
                instantiated (i.e. an objectv is created) memory is allocated but 
                 when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created)
                memory is allocated.
            <br>
            <b>Class: </b>The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented 
            programming is a Class.It is user defined data type, which hold its own
            data members and memberfunctions, which can be accesed & used by creating 
            an instance of that class.A class is like a blueprint for an object.
            For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with 
            different names and brand but all of them will share some common properties 
            like all of them will have four wheels, Speed limit, Mileage range etc.
            so here, car is the class and wheels, speed limits,Mileage are their properties.

                     The capability of a class to derive

                     Inheritance is one of the most important

                     Sub Class: The class that inherits properties
                     from another class is called Sub classes or
                     Derived Class.
                     Super Class: The class whose properties are 
                     inherited by sub class is called Base Class or
                     Super class. Using inheritance, we have to write 
                     the functions only one time instead of three times
                     as we have inherited rest of three times as we
                     have inherited rest of the three class from 
                     base class (Vechicle).
